No stonework can be seen on the walls or the ceiling twenty feet above, for some cement or plaster has been smoothed over all of these surfaces and then illustrated. The scenes show fields with kine grazing, workers of various races and strange human-animal mixtures--pig human, ape-human, and dog-human--going about various tasks. Certain of the frescoes show rooms of some building--a library filled with many books and scrolls, the door of a torture chamber, and a wizard\'s work room. There are chairs, windows, boxes, bales, doors, chests, birds, bats, spiders, and all manner of things shown on the walls.',
